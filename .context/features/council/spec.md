# Multi-agent council — spec

confidence: INFERRED

## Intent

The council is dummyindex's per-feature documentation pipeline: for every non-trivial feature it drives a fixed sequence of LLM stages — dev drafts `spec.md`, an architect reorganises `plan.md`, critics file `concerns.md`, dev narrates flows, and (optionally) a tree-enrich pass — fanning *independent* features out to parallel Task subagents. The implementation here is the **deterministic plumbing** the LLM skill calls between dispatches: it has no LLM. It computes, from the append-only per-feature audit logs alone, the *earliest incomplete stage* across all features and the concrete dispatch units (which agent, for which feature, in which role) to launch for it, then records each invocation's outcome so a crashed or partial run resumes without re-doing finished work. `council.py:1-34` states the three log purposes — resume, surface failures, audit. `council_batch.py:1-10` frames it as the council twin of build's `next_wave`.

## User-visible behavior

### `council-batch --next` (frontier)

`dummyindex context council-batch --next` prints the next parallel dispatch frontier (`cli/council_batch.py:65-188`). It loads every feature id from `features/INDEX.json` (`cli/council_batch.py:54-62`), optionally scopes via repeatable `--feature ID`, then asks the domain for the earliest incomplete stage and its units. Flags: `--depth light|standard|deep` (canonical; `--mode` is a back-compat alias — passing both is rejected), `--cap N` (default 8), `--tree-enrich`, `--json`, and `--feature ID --force` for a scoped forced re-council (`cli/council_batch.py:75-129`). The effort is resolved through `config.resolve_depth(.., DepthCommand.BUILD, depth_flag)` — precedence `--depth`/`--mode` flag → `config.command_depths[build]` → `config.mode` → `standard` — so an unset flag now honours a per-command `command_depths` override instead of a bare `standard` default (`cli/council_batch.py:105-129`). Human output names stage, unit count, and one `feature: role → subagent_type [framework]` line per unit (`cli/council_batch.py:177-188`); `--json` emits `{complete, stage, mode, cap, forced, units[]}` (`cli/council_batch.py:164-173`). When every active stage is complete it prints `all features complete for this mode.` (`cli/council_batch.py:177-179`). Before dispatching, it warns on stderr when more than half the scoped features carry enrichment artifacts but empty logs — the pre-v0.20 shape that would re-run and clobber curated docs (`cli/council_batch.py:27-51`).

### `council-log`

`dummyindex context council-log --feature ID --stage N --agent NAME --status STATUS [--note ...]` appends one audit entry (validated status / non-negative stage / agent name) to `features/<id>/council/_council-log.json` via `council.append_log` (`council.py:103-160`). The `council-log backfill [--feature ID]` subverb (`cli/council.py:77-142`) synthesises `complete` entries for stages whose council-authored artifacts already exist on disk but have no log records, so a pre-v0.20 index is not wrongly rescheduled from stage 1.

### `dev-pick`

The dev-stage picker resolves *which* stack-specialist authoring persona writes a feature's docs, deterministically and first-match-wins over a precedence table (`dev_pick.py:255-273`), from the feature's file list plus the repo's harvested dependency tokens. It always returns a persona (the constant-true fallback rule guarantees it), and supplies an ordered `fallbacks` ladder of alternative agents to try when the primary subagent isn't installed (`dev_pick.py:52-63`).

# Forced, scoped re-council of an already-complete feature.

# One-time fixup of a pre-v0.20 index before the first frontier call.
