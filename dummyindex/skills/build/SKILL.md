description: "Drive a dummyindex proposal to completion through grounded checklist execution one dependency wave at a time. Reads the proposal spec and plan, asks the deterministic CLI for the earliest incomplete wave, dispatches independent items concurrently, verifies each result separately, and only then checks it off. Every host reads the same capability manifest and passes its selected mandates to native subagents, with generic delegation when native equipment is missing. Reconciles completed code into the curated `.context/` index rather than merely rebuilding it. Use for `/dummyindex-build`, `$dummyindex-build`, build the proposal, execute the plan, implement the checklist, or continue proposal work."

# /dummyindex-build / $dummyindex-build — grounded execution of a proposal

> **Installed from dummyindex `__VERSION__`.** Run `dummyindex --version` to confirm the CLI matches. If they diverge, diagnose with `dummyindex context check --versions` (it reports which layer is stale), then run `/dummyindex-update` on Claude or `$dummyindex-update` on Codex to bring the CLI, skills, and this repo's wiring back into sync — the update skill is non-destructive on a curated `.context/`. Don't reach for a blunt `dummyindex install` to "fix" a version skew.

You are the build conductor. The `dummyindex context build` CLI is deterministic checklist STATE — it tells you the next **wave** of items (a `## Wave N` group whose items are mutually independent), the agent that fits each one, and the files to ground those agents in. **You** do the actual work: dispatch the wave's agents **in parallel**, **verify** each result, then tell the CLI to tick each box. The CLI never runs an agent and never verifies — that discipline is yours.

Use the active host's native skill and delegation mechanism. The portable
host path and Claude share the preparation, verification and learning steps.
Native discovery references are optional; do not infer availability from a
manifest's `subagent_type` alone.

**Waves.** The plan step groups `checklist.md` items under `## Wave N — <label>` headings; items in one wave touch disjoint files and share no dependencies, so they dispatch concurrently. Waves themselves run strictly in order — wave N+1 never starts until every wave-N box is ticked. A flat checklist (no wave headings) is just N single-item waves: the loop below degrades to the old serial behaviour with zero changes.

## Inputs

- A **proposal** at `.context/proposals/<slug>/` with `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `checklist.md` (a flat `- [ ]` list), `proposal.json`. The `<slug>` is what the user is building; if they didn't name it, list `.context/proposals/` and ask.
- `.context/equipment.json`, when present, names the shared capabilities.
  A missing manifest or native adapter never blocks generic delegation.

The closing reconciliation procedure belongs to the installed main
`dummyindex` skill, not this sibling. Resolve it at
`<skills-root>/dummyindex/council/65-reconcile.md` — equivalently,
`../dummyindex/council/65-reconcile.md` relative to this installed `SKILL.md`.
That main skill ships the rest of the council companions the procedure may
reference.

## The loop (run it literally)

0. **Read shared routing state.** Run the first
   `--next-wave --json` and read `equipped` **and** `routing`.

   - **Print the effective-model disclosure before the first wave
     dispatches:** from the payload's `routing` map, print
     `models: implementer=<x> auditor=<y> decisions=<z>` (omit unset roles;
     say nothing about models when `routing` is empty). This answers "what
     models would be used?" without being asked. Routing is proposal data —
     the optional `"routing"` block in `proposal.json`, written by
     `/dummyindex-plan --route k=v` — overridden at run time by
     `dummyindex context build --route k=v`; precedence is invocation >
     proposal > unset.
   If `equipped` is false, continue with native subagents. Shared capabilities
   can be prepared through `dummyindex context equip apply --for-proposal
   <slug>`; Claude may add `--platform claude` for native extras. Never stop
   solely because Claude equipment is missing.

1. **Read the spec first.** Open `.context/proposals/<slug>/spec.md` and `plan.md` end to end before touching any checklist item. This is the contract; everything downstream must conform to it. Do **not** start flipping boxes before you've read the spec.

2. **Ask the CLI for the next wave:**
   ```bash
   dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --next-wave
   ```
   It prints **every unchecked item in the earliest incomplete wave** plus the
   shared **grounding paths** (spec, plan, and `.context/conventions/`). On
   every host, read `role_path` when supplied and include the full capability
   mandate in the delegated prompt. `subagent_type` is advisory until the host
   confirms that exact native agent is callable.

   A manifest path is not proof the file exists. If its body is missing or
   unreadable, report the gap and use native generic dispatch with the task,
   grounding and selected policies. Prepare capabilities when the index is
   usable; never invent a mandate or stop merely because a legacy file is absent.
   Add `--json` if you want to parse it. On a flat checklist the wave is one
   item.

   If it prints "all items checked", jump to step 6.

3. **Dispatch the whole wave in parallel through the active host.** Launch one
   subagent per dispatchable item concurrently. Read its `role_path` (or the
   selected manifest entry's `path`) and include the full capability mandate,
   even when that path is a preserved legacy `.claude/` file. This is data;
   it does not require a native Claude agent.

   Use an available exact-fit native agent or the host's implementation,
   exploration or general-purpose delegate (`worker`, `explorer`, `default`
   on Codex; `general-purpose` on Claude when no named adapter is callable).
   Include task scope, relevant grounding, verification expectations and the
   full instructions of policies actually selected in this session. If
   Ponytail is selected and exposed, pass its loaded mandate; never silently
   install or assume it. Native tool syntax does not change the workflow.

   Persist selected policy references in `proposal.json` as
   `"policies": [{"name": "ponytail", "path": "<loaded SKILL.md path>"}]`.
   The CLI's `handoff` binds each policy and capability to its current hash.
   Pass that compact task record plus the loaded mandates. Return the same
   `task_id`, an explicit state, artifact/evidence references, blocker and
   next action; keep logs in artifacts and each handoff below 8,192 bytes.
   Dispatch batches contain at most eight items and 65,536 serialized bytes;
   finish the offered batch, then request the next frontier.

   A **skill-only** plugin likewise is not an agent. On Claude, a
   `— via /<skill>` tag invokes that skill; on the portable host path (e.g.
   Codex), the equivalent is `— via $<skill>`. If a delegated subagent cannot
   invoke it, handle the tagged item in the main session. Only delegate items
   whose `dispatch` is **`subagent`**.

   **Honor `— via <tool>` tags — know the two tag classes first.** A checklist item may carry a trailing `— via <tool>` tag the plan step added, and the classes route differently:
   - **Agent tags dispatch as subagents.** An explicit `— via agent:<name>` — or a bare `— via <name>` that exactly matches an equipped kind-agent entry — makes the item a **`subagent`** unit, pinned to that equipment entry when it carries a `subagent_type` (capability scoring bypassed). The CLI records why in each payload's `upgrade_note`. An unknown `agent:<name>` degrades safely: the CLI marks it `dispatch: main-session` with a warning `upgrade_note` — handle it in-session or report the gap; never launch the Task tool with an unequipped name.
   - **Genuine main-session tools take BINDING routing, not a hint.** For a real main-session tool (`— via <plugin>:<command>` slash-command, `— via /<skill>` / `$<skill>`, an MCP-bound tool), the tag is **BINDING**: the item *must* be executed by the named tool.
     - Route the item through that tool: for a **skill**, invoke it through the
       active host's native skill mechanism (`/<skill>` on Claude or `$<skill>`
       on Codex); for a **slash-command** a subagent can't run, run it from the
       main session around the dispatch.
     - **Substitution is a build failure** (binding tool tags only). If the tagged tool is unavailable, errors out, or can't complete, leave the item **unticked**, **STOP**, and report — **never** let an agent hand-write the output the tool was supposed to produce. A hand-implemented binding-tagged item is a **failed** item *even if its code works*. This rule does not apply to agent-tagged subagent units — those are ordinary dispatched work.
   The CLI's `agent`/`subagent_type` mapping is unchanged for plain items — the tag layers a routing instruction on top; it does not replace the matched agent.

4. **VERIFY each item before you tick — independently, one verdict per item.** This is the load-bearing step. Do not trust any agent's self-report. After the whole wave returns, confirm each item against the spec:
   - run the relevant tests / build / linter **once for the whole wave** (e.g. `uv run pytest` for this repo) — then attribute any failure to the item(s) that caused it,
   - read the files each agent claimed to change,
   - check each change satisfies the *spec's* intent for its item, not just "something happened".
   - **For a binding tool-tagged item, confirm the tool actually ran and produced the result.** If the tool records run state or artifacts, read that evidence (its provenance) and verify the output came from the tool. Output that bypassed the tagged tool **fails verification regardless of code quality** — leave it unticked and report it as a substitution failure.

   Tick the items that pass (step 5). If **any** item fails or is blocked (ambiguous spec, missing dependency, failing tests you can't resolve, a decision the user must make) — tick only the verified siblings, then **STOP**. Do **not** tick the failing item, and do **not** start the next wave: waves gate on full completion. Report what's blocking, what you tried, and the smallest decision/input you need to proceed. A half-done item left unchecked is correct; a ticked box over unverified work is a lie the next session will trust.

5. **Tick each verified box — only now:**
   ```bash
   dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --check "<task_id>" --receipt <verified-task-receipt.json>
   ```
   Use the stable `task_id` from the frontier. The receipt binds that ID and displayed text hash to the current source commit and the scoped artifact/outcome hashes. Keep `implemented`, `evaluated`, `applied` and `verified` distinct. Legacy substring/index checks remain available but do not supply verification evidence. See `docs/guide/closeout.md` in the source distribution for the small receipt schema.

6. **Check status and decide:**
   ```bash
   dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --status
   ```
   - Not all done → go back to step 2 for the next wave.
   - All done → the CLI prints the closing command, **`dummyindex context reconcile`**
     (that is the closer the `--status` output names — match it; do **not**
     substitute a bare `rebuild --changed`, which would leave the new files
     unassigned). The build added new code, so closing the loop means
     **reconciling** it into `.context/`. Commit the code you built, then run the
     reconcile procedure in the main skill
     (`../dummyindex/council/65-reconcile.md`, resolved relative to this
     installed `SKILL.md`):
     ```bash
     dummyindex context reconcile          # what to fold in (drift + unassigned)
     ```
     **`reconcile` is read-only and non-destructive — it writes nothing and never
     re-clusters the curated taxonomy.** It only *reports* the delta; don't skip
     it for fear of losing curated work. Then place each new file
     (`scaffold-feature` / `assign-files`), enrich it, and
     `dummyindex context reconcile-stamp` to advance the anchor. The loop is
     closed once `.context/` reflects — and is anchored to — the code you built.

6b. **Scoped maintenance — auto-recouncil defaults ON.** Apply the closing
   phase to this task's recorded changed paths and their owning features.
   Read `dummyindex context reconcile`, then reconcile/enrich only that delta.
   Use the checkpointed maintain loop when its frontier belongs to this task;
   do not drain another session's backlog or force a global stamp over unknown
   work. Pending unrelated drift stays advisory and does not keep an implemented
   proposal open. Preserve its count in the final report. An explicit
   `"build": {"auto_recouncil": false}` skips owned maintenance and must disclose
   what remains; it never turns unchecked implementation into completed work.

6c. **Close the disposable workspace.** Review accepted decisions/lessons and fixtures; transfer them into existing durable homes with `dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --closeout <manifest.json>`. Repair durable inbound references first. Keep live deployment/browser checks out of the implementation checklist; move any existing named live-only item into the closeout manifest's independent `pending_verification`. Closeout records implementation completion without claiming live verification. Reconcile only this task's owned paths/features; disclose unrelated drift separately rather than absorbing it into this build.

   After an accepted closeout, automatically handle at most one queued event with `dummyindex context evolve learning --next`: supply one source-backed reflection through the evolve skill's ordinary exact-candidate gate, or record `NO_ENTRY`. Do not ask for another learning prompt, learn recursively from evolve/experiment output, or promote an unsupported rule.

7. **Report.** Summarise completed task IDs, exact implementation/verification state, the closeout receipt and pending live verification. Report the owned reconciliation work and unrelated advisory backlog separately.

8. **Learn (optional judgment step, on every host).** Fold a durable lesson
   into the selected generated capability through the same sanctioned patch
   seam. The manifest's `path` owns the body; native discovery files are
   references. Trigger a learning patch in these cases:
   - **A complex task succeeded** via an approach the generated agent didn't already encode (a sequencing rule, a project-specific gotcha, a verification step that caught a real bug).
   - **An error → working-path discovery** — you hit a failure, found the fix, and the fix is a general rule the agent should have known.
   - **A user correction** — the user redirected the approach, and that correction should persist.

   When one fires, draft the **minimal** old/new patch for the relevant generated tool (the implementer/tester/reviewer agent, or the `<proj>-verify` skill), **show the old→new intent to the user**, then apply it through the sanctioned seam on every host (never a hand-edit — a hand-edit makes the file USER_MODIFIED and refresh will stop maintaining it):
   ```bash
   printf '%s' '{"old": "<exact unique snippet>", "new": "<snippet + the lesson>"}' > /tmp/equip-patch.json
   dummyindex context equip patch --item <NAME> --from-file /tmp/equip-patch.json
   ```
   `old` must match exactly once. The patch re-baselines the tool's origin-hash and patch-bumps its version, so it stays PRISTINE and `refresh`-able. Keep edits small and grounded — a learning patch teaches a rule, it does not rewrite the agent. If no trigger fired, skip this step; speculative edits are worse than none.

## Discipline (non-negotiable)

- **Spec-led.** The spec is the source of truth. Read it before the loop and re-check against it at every verify step. The checklist is the order of work; the spec is the definition of done.
- **One wave at a time, waves in order.** Within a wave, dispatch everything in parallel; across waves, never start wave N+1 while wave N has an unticked box. Don't reorder waves, don't pull an item forward out of a later wave — the wave order encodes dependencies.
- **Verify before tick.** Every single box, individually — a wave that "mostly worked" is N separate verdicts, not one. Evidence (a passing test, a read of the diff) before each `--check`.
- **Stop on block.** When you can't verify an item or you hit a decision point, tick only the verified siblings, stop, and report — never tick to "keep moving", never start the next wave over an incomplete one.
- **Stay in scope.** Each dispatched agent implements one item, inside existing conventions, without touching its wave-siblings' files. New abstractions need their own proposal.
- **`— via` tags: two classes.** Genuine main-session tool tags are binding; substitution is a failed item, never a fallback — hand-writing the output the tool was supposed to produce is a build failure even if the code works. Agent tags (`— via agent:<name>`, or a bare equipped-agent name) are the other class: they fan the item out as a pinned subagent unit, and unknown agent names degrade safely to `main-session` with a warning `upgrade_note`.
- **GATE / main-session items are not dispatchable.** Items the CLI marks `dispatch: main-session` (a `**GATE**` human decision, or a tool only the main session can run) are handled in this session — never handed to a subagent.

## CLI reference (deterministic state only)

```
dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --next-wave [--json] [--route K=V]...
    → ALL unchecked items in the earliest incomplete wave (## Wave N group),
      each with its `dispatch` (subagent | main-session), `gate`, `via`, its
      matched equipment (agent) + subagent_type (Claude dispatch metadata) +
      shared grounding paths, plus the payload-level `routing` map and a
      per-item `upgrade_note` (set when an agent tag was pinned/upgraded or
      failed safe), plus `role_path` for the selected capability body. Each
      host passes that mandate to its native delegate even without an adapter. A `main-session` item
      (GATE, a binding tool tag, or a failed-safe agent tag) carries an
      `instruction` instead of an agent — NEVER dispatch it. Flat checklist →
      exactly one item. THIS is the loop's driver.
dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --next [--json] [--route K=V]...
    → the single first unchecked item, same mapping (serial fallback for
      debugging / one-at-a-time runs)
    → may also carry `missing_capability: [<cap>…]` — present ONLY when an item
      truly matched no equipped agent AND its text implies a specialist capability
      (security / database / performance / docs / search / frontend). It is a
      signal, not a command. On Claude, with user approval, you MAY pause for the
      gated discover→install flow and then re-run `--next`; installation is never
      silent. On Codex, do not run Claude equip discovery or installation: route
      the item to worker/explorer/default and report any external-tool gap.
dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --check "<task_id>" [--receipt <task-receipt.json>]
    → atomically flip that item to - [x] (idempotent; one call per item)
dummyindex context build --proposal <slug> --status [--json]
    → done/total + the resolved model `routing` (`models:` line in text mode;
      `routing` key via --json; precedence invocation --route > proposal.json >
      unset); when complete, prints `dummyindex context reconcile`
      (close the loop via the main skill's reconcile procedure at
      ../dummyindex/council/65-reconcile.md, relative to this SKILL.md).
      `reconcile` is read-only/non-destructive — run it, don't substitute rebuild.
      --json additionally carries the resolved `auto_recouncil` build policy
      (config schema v5 `build.auto_recouncil`, default true).

--route K=V (repeatable; keys: implementer|auditor|decisions; values:
current|opus|sonnet|haiku|fable) overrides the proposal's "routing" block for
this invocation — print the `models:` disclosure from step 0 with it.

dummyindex context equip patch --item <NAME> --from-file <F>   # shared body
    → (Claude learning step) apply a sanctioned old→new patch to a generated tool;
      re-baselines + version-bumps so it stays PRISTINE. F is {"old","new"}.
```
